## Simulating Transmission Power Infrastructural System Performance during Hurricanes with a Physics-based Data Generation Engine

This package contains codes of an open source data generation engine that simulates the chain effect of power infrastructure damage and network failure during a hurricane event. 

### Code Environment and Required Software
The bulk part of the software is developed with the python programming language and is tested with python version 3.6. The IBM CPLEX Optimization software is required for running the codes.
