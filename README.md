## Simulating Transmission Power Infrastructural System Performance during Hurricanes with a Physics-based Data Generation Engine

This package contains codes of an open source data generation engine that simulates the chain effect of power infrastructure damage and network failure during a hurricane event. 

This software is tested with Python version 3.6.
