# Power Systems Resilience Analysis during Extreme Weather Software Implementation: Python Packages Installation Instruction

The resilience analysis of regional power systems under extreme events is prevalent due to the crippling social impacts and substantial economic losses caused by bulk power outages. The study of hurricaneâ€™s impact on the power system infrastructure helps find the weak links in the system and helps in clarifying the efficient restoration and recovery procedures. To evaluate the performance of the power systems under hurricane events, a data generation engine is developed using Python programming language. Using the developed Python scripts, some necessary packages, software are needed. This Python package installation instruction aimed at providing guidelines to successfully running the scripts.

## Basic Python Programming Language Terminology

In this section, a few Python Programming language terminologies will be introduced to help understan the Python basics. The full Python programming language introduction can be found at [Python Introduction](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_intro.asp).

* **Python version**: [python.org](https://www.python.org/) will release different version of Python every year. Even though the main functionality is the same, each version of Python has slightly different functionalities. The Python version is important when some libraries (packages) only support specific versions of Python. If Python has been installed, the version of Python can be checked by:
  
  * Windows: Open PowerShell and type `python --version` 
* Mac: Open Terminal and type `python --version`
  
* **IDE**: IDE is short for Integrated Development Environment. Python built-in IDLE is useful for running simple codes. But using IDEs, larger and more complex programming projects can be easily handled. In the market, there are lots of free and proprietary IDEs, for example ([Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), [Spider](https://www.spyder-ide.org/)).  All IDEs can help manage and organize the project, the preference is based on personal choice.

* **Virtual Environment**: Python virtual environment is a tool used for Python package management and project isolation. It allows Python packages to be installed locally in a separate directory for a particular project.

* **Packages**: A python packages consists of several modules. A module is a Python program that is a reusable code that serves particular purpose. In essence, Python packages contains a cluster of functions that can be used repeatedly.

* **API**: API is short for Application Programming Interface. It is a server that the user can use to retrieve and send data via code. The interaction between the code and API is illustrated in the following figure. The full Python API introduction can be found at [Python API tutorial: Getting Started with APIs](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/python-api-tutorial/).

###  Python IDEs

Python IDE is an editor that helps manage large, complex Python projects.  In the market, there are lots of free and charged IDEs, for example ([Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) and [Spider](https://www.spyder-ide.org/)). In this instruction, [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) is used as a demonstration for the current and latter instructions. For other user-preferred IDEs, the user can visit their website to know the details about installation.

* Go to   [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) and click download button. The download button is on the upper-right in the website.
* In the downloading page, choose which operational system (Windows, Mac, Linux) the current machine is used and choose _Community_ version.

* Check the installation. If Pycharm has been successfully installed, after opening it, Pycharm will look like:

![open pycharm](installation figures/open pycharm.png)

* **Install Anaconda**: In this software, the virtual environment will be created using Anaconda. Therefore, the users need to install Anaconda. The Anaconda downloading page can be found at [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/).

## IBM CPLEX Optimization software installation

One objective of this project is to find the optimal dispatch strategy during hurricane events. Therefore, optimization package is needed to perform such tasks.  In this project, IBM CPLEX package is used. The installation of IBM CPLEX is as follow:

* **Java**: Check whether Java is installed in the computer by:

  * **Windows**: Open PowerShell and type `java -version` 
  * **Mac**: Open Terminal and type `java -version`

  If java is not installed, visit [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) to download the latest version.

* **IBM CPLEX**: Go to [IBM CPLEX Optimization Studio](https://www.ibm.com/products/ilog-cplex-optimization-studio) official website. 

  * In the website, choose the no-cost academic edition as shown in the dashed-red box figure below.

## Setup IBM CPLEX Python API

Even though IBM CPLEX has been installed, to use this optimizer in Python, the users need to set up CPLEX Python API so that Python can find and use CPLEX. To setup IBM CPLEX Python API, the instructions on Windows and Mac system will be illustrated separately. 

To set up CPLEX Python API, the user need to set up the Python Virtual Environment First. 

* Creating Virtual Environment
  * Open Pycharm $\rightarrow$ Open where the Python scripts are stored 

  ![ve1](installation figures/ve1.png)

  * Open setting in Pycharm ribbon $\rightarrow$ Settings $\rightarrow$ Interpreter $\rightarrow$ Add local interpreter $\rightarrow$ `Conda Environment`. In the `Conda Environment` select the Python version no latter than 3.6 and click `OK`.

  ![ve2](installation figures/ve2.png)

* Setup CPLEX Python API

  * Windows:  

    * in the search bar type `cmd` $\rightarrow$ choose `Anaconda Prompt (anaconda3)` and run as an administrator

    ![ve3](installation figures/ve3.png)

    * In PowerShell type the following commands to activate the local virtual environment

    ```terminal
    conda env list
    conda activate 'user created Virtual Enviornment name'
    ```

    In the figure below, the `*` mean the current working Virtual Environment. If the current working Virtual Environment is base, change to user created virtual environment name. If the local virtual environment is activated, it should appear in the front of the director shown in the figure below.

    ![ve4](installation figures/ve4.png)

    * Setup CPLEX API

    If user follows up default settings, the setup file should be located in `C:\Program Files\IBM\ILOG\CPLEX_Studio221\python`.  In PowerShell type the following commands:

    ```termial
    cd ..
    dir
    cd '.\Program Files\'
    python IBM\ILOG\CPLEX_Studio221\python\setup.py install
    ```

    Then the CPLEX API should be installed properly.

  * Mac

    * Open terminal and type

    ```terminal
    conda env list
    conda activate 'user created Virtual Enviornment name'
    ```

    * Setup CPLEX API

    If user follows up default settings, the setup file should be located in `/Application/CPLEX_Studio221/python`.  In Terminal type the following commands:

    ```terminal
    cd `/Application/CPLEX_Studio221/python`
    python setup.py install
    ```

    Then the CPLEX API should be installed properly.
